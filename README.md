# Save-the-Ship
My own take on the Rimworld mod Save our Ship / Save our Ship reloaded.

I will be branching off from the pipakin branch of the orginal mod by Kentington

Early goals are to remove everything that doesn't currently work, and slim things down so they can be smooth as possible

additionally i plan to document some of the more "hidden" features of the mod and highlight them


Notes:

currently when ship is fully sealed you will need to have ~10 plants per pawn inside the ship at all times to maintain O2 levels
